## Intructions
The goal here is to just build a simple to-do app. It should have the following functionalities:
- The user can add something to a list
- The user can see all items on the list
- The user can delete something from the list

To get started: 
- On your laptop, find the Xcode application by typing cmd + space, typing in xcode, then press return
- Click Create a new Xcode project
- Under Choose a template for your new project, select iOS and App
- Click the blue Next button in the bottom right corner
- You must check the Use Core Data box! **
- You will be prompted to save this file. For Product Name, type in whatever name your want to officially title your app, then click the blue Create button in the bottom right corner.
- From the top menu, select Source Control then New Git Repositories. Click Create on the pop up.

From here it would probably be easier to first create a static version of the application and then make it dynamic. I have more in-depth instructions (like basically a walk-through) if you want but it might be better if you attempt it independently first.
